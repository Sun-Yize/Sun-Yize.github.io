Welcome! I am currently a Master of Artificial Intelligence student in [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I obtained my Bachelor degree in Statistics from [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My research interests mainly lie in Big Data Analysis, Data Mining and Computer Vision.
